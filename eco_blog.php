            <h1><strong>Economic Introduction</strong></h1>
            <li>
                Economics is a social science that investigates how people, organizations, governments, and communities
                distribute limited resources to meet their endless wants and requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                It addresses the creation, circulation, and consumption of products and services and examines how people
                make decisions in the face of
                scarcity.
            </li>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="para2">
            <h1><strong>Key Economic Concepts:</strong></h1>
            <p>Following are Some Key Concepts of Economics</p>
            <li><em>Scarcity:</em>
                The basic economic issue of finite resources in the face of unending desires and
                requirements. When resources are few, people and communities must decide how to allocate them wisely.
            </li>
            <li><em>Supply and Demand:</em>
                On the basis of market-based economies, the quantity of goods or services that producers are willing to
                offer at various price points is known as supply, whereas the quantity that customers are prepared to
                pay at various prices is known as demand. Market equilibrium and pricing are determined by the
                relationship between supply and demand.
            </li>
            <li><em>Opportunity Cost:</em>
                The worth of the best option was passed up when choosing. Every time a choice is made, there are other
                possibilities that must be forgone. Making sensible judgments is easier for people and corporations when
                they understand the opportunity cost.
            </li>
            <li><em>Incentives:</em>
                Factors that cause people or organizations to behave in a particular way are Positive (rewards,
                benefits) and negative (penalties, consequences) incentives, both of which have a significant impact on
                behavior and decision-making.
            </li>
            <li><em>Macroeconomics:</em>
                The research of the entire economy GDP (Gross Domestic Product), inflation, unemployment, fiscal and
                monetary policy, as well as overall economic development and stability, are just a few of the variables
                that macroeconomics studies.
            </li>
            <li><em>Microeconomics:</em>
                The research of distinct economic entities includes markets, enterprises, and households. Microeconomics
                focuses on issues including resource allocation at a smaller scale, consumer behavior, production costs,
                and market systems.
            </li>
            <li><em>Economic Systems:</em>
                There are many methods for structuring and managing economic activity. Markets, private property, and
                government intervention all play different roles in the diverse economic systems represented by
                capitalism, socialism, and mixed economies.
            </li>
            <li><em>International Trades:</em>
                The cross-border exchange of goods and services Countries can specialize in manufacturing commodities or
                services in which they have a comparative advantage through international trade, and they can profit
                from the export of those goods to other countries.
            </li>
            <li><em>Economic Growth and Development:</em>
                The gradual rise in an economy's output Technological developments, investments, infrastructure
                development, and improvements in education all contribute to economic growth. Enhancing people's quality
                of life and general well-being is referred to as economic development.
            </li>
            <li><em>Economic Policy:</em>
                Governmental actions are taken to control and affect economic activity. While monetary policy focuses on
                managing interest rates, the money supply, and controlling inflation, fiscal policy deals with
                government spending, taxes, and borrowing.
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class="para3">
            <h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
            <li>A framework for understanding and assessing a wide range of subjects, such as personal finance,
                corporate
                decision-making, governmental policies, international trade, income inequality, environmental
                sustainability, and more, is provided by the study of economics.
            </li>
            <li>
                People can develop an understanding of the
                factors influencing our world and use that knowledge to make decisions that will advance economic
                prosperity
                by studying economics.
